 ## CODE

 - Code for animated supplement search bar sourced from this [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_form_search_anim) page


## TESTING
### Moving throught the pages
Home Page - User Clicks on any of the 4 navigation list items and this accurately take user to the corresponding page. The nav bar stays consistent throughout all the pages and the user can see what page they are on as the corresponding icon for that page changes colour in the nav bar and it becomes highligthed green<br>

Footer Features - User can also use the "Our Servies" section links at the bottom of the pages to navigate as the links are clickable and can take you to any of the pages. For example - User is on Clinic Page and gets to the bottom of page and wants to go the Wellbeing Shop page, rather than scroll all the way back to top of page they can click on the Wellbeing Shop link in the footer. Theses links are working accurately.

### Bugs Discovered

#### 1) Logo issue
The logo being used at the top of all the pages is not to the best scale and the other logos with the 'PEABA HEALTH' wording which would be better ad brand the site more do not scale very well to fit in the designated area

#### 1) Solution
Possibly getting a larger scale logo made up which will not distort on expansion with the PEABA HEALTH wording inlcuded. This will will add to the attraction of the site and make more appealing to the user.

#### 2) Nav Icon Positioning
Trouble with getting Nav Icons to sit in correct positions on all pages
Having difficulty with trying to get the Nav Icons to sit in the correct positions on the page. Would like to have the Search Bar to the right of the nav bar and be fluid on smaller devices when made smaller and search button to sit correctly.

#### 2) Solution
Have used the bootstrap navbar class property to help make the nav bar more fluid and responsive with all categories going into a single line on screen sized smaller than 768px.

The search form, button and LogIn/register icons are now also nicely sat on the right of the nav icons and are also responsive within the navbar class property used.

#### 3) Hovering over Icons/thumbnails to bring up a descriptive text
Trouble getting icons when hovered over to change opacity and have descriptive text appear on over them - 

#### 3)Solution
This feature has been left out and is to be added on future versions of website with more dynamic web features used.

#### 4) Hovering over descriptive text above each category
This is not highlighting green the same way the image is

#### 4) Solution
Manage to sort this issue by using the correct class to target the element with the CSS styling However on reflection it did not look as good as expected and so removed the feature

#### 5) Wellbeing shop page - icons were not spacing correctly
When resizing the responsiveness of the category icons they were not spacing correctly.

#### 5) Solution
I set each category icon with a fixed width and height of 250px and on top of that set the margin to auto which in turn spaced them correctly. Using the Bootstrap row and col features to set the amount of icons per line depending on the screen size correctly.

#### 6) Clinic page Icon
The Clinic Page Icon keeps on floating to the left of the screen rather than staying central. Also its sizing is not to the same sizing as the other icons on other pages which is causing visual problems as it is coming up much bigger

#### 6) Solution
Because this icon is sitting in a bootstrap row on its own, I solved this problem by creating two extra divs on either side of the div for the icon therefor giving it a col-4 split rather than something bigger which is causing the sizing problem as all the icons are responsive rather than being given fixed sizes. This meant that based on the width and height percentages set for the images it scaled the icon down to a similar size to the other page icons.

#### Validating the code with W3 validator - HTML:
Using the [w3c Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) - 
    *Some errors were flagged up on the html files of this project. The main issue being that I was using <a> tags as direct children of <ul> tags which is considered invalid. On this information I swapped arround the the <li> tags with my <a> tags so that the <a> was a child of my <li> tags. This solved the error flaggind up on the validator when I inserted my code with Direct Inout option.

#### Validating the code with W3 validator - CSS:
Using the [w3c Validator CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    * And error message was generated with the validator in regards to the background image of the body. The background image value of no-repeat center center was not necessary - on removing this propert in the CSS the image reamined the same and stayed responsive on resizing with no bugs.

    * Line 82 in the CSS code had an error with the padding on the left of the divs in the footer section. The bug as fixed via the correct syntax of the "padding-left" being used - this was initially incorectly written as "padding left" as two seperate words and then a value of 2rem used to space the wording/icons away from the edge of the div.


### Testing responsiveness
- Using Google DevTools - Able to resize each page using the responsive feature to see how the pages alter through the range of screen sizes. - This shows the icons maintain the adequate spacing and layots to keep information presentable and maintain the appeal of the pages.
