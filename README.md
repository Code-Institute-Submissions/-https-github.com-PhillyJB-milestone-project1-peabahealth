## TESTING

### Bugs Discovered

#### 1a) Logo issue
The logo being used at the top of all the pages is not to the best scale and the other logos with the PEABA HEALTH wording which would better do not scale very welll to fit in the designation area

#### 1b) Solution
Possibly getting a larger scale logo made up which will not distort on expansion with the PEABA HEALTH wording inlcuded. This will will add to the attraction of the site and make more appealing to the user.

#### 1a) Nav Icon Positioning
Trouble with getting Nav Icons to sit in correct positions on all pages
Having difficulty with tryin to get the Nav Icons to sit in the correct positions on the page. Would like to have the the Search Bar to the right of the nav bar and be fluid on smaller devices when mad smaller and search button to sit correctly.

#### 1b) Solution
Have used the bootstrap navbar class property to help make my nav bar more fluid and responsive with all categories going into a single line on screen sized smaller than 768px.

The search form, button and LogIn/register icons are now also nicely sat on the right of the nav icons and are also responsive within the navbar class property used.

#### 2a) Hovering over Icons/thumbnails to bring up a descriptive text
Trouble getting icons when hovered over to change opacity and have descriptive text appear on over them - 

#### 2b)Solution
This feature has been left out and is to be added on future versions of website with more dynamic web features used.

#### 3a) Hovering over descriptive text above each category
This is not highlighting green the same way the image is

#### 3b) Solution
Manage to sort this issue by using the correct class to target the element with the CSS styling Howevrer on reflection it did not look as good as expected and so removed the feature

#### 4a) Wellbeing shop page - icons were not spacing correctly
When resizing the responsiveness of the category icons they were not spacing correctly.

#### 4b) Solution
I set each category icon with a fixed width and height of 250px and on top of set the margin to auto which in turn spaced them correctly. Using the Bootstrap row and col features to set the amount if icons per line depending on the screen size correctly.

#### 5a) CLinic page Icon
The Clinic Page Icon keeps on floating to the left of the screen rather than staying central. Also its sizing is not to the same sixing as the other icons on other pages which is causing visual problems as it is coming up much bigger

#### 5b) Solution
Because this icon is sitting in a bootstrap row on its own, I solved this problem by creating two extra div's on either side of the div for the icon therefor giving it a col-4 split rather than something bigger which is causing the sizin problem as all the icons are responsive rather than being given fixed sizes. This meant that based on the mwidth ans height %s set for the images it scaled the icon down to a similar size to the other oage icons.

### Usability testing and responsiveness

- User arrives on Site home page
